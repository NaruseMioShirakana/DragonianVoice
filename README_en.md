# Sub-models
Stopped updating (due to download and upload speed): [Vocoder & HiddenUnitBert](https://github.com/NaruseMioShirakana/RequireMent-Model-For-MoeSS) 

Latest repository link : [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/NaruseMioShirakana/MoeSS-SUBModel) 

Notes on exporting onnx sub models:
- HuBert: input_names should be ["source"], output_names should be ["embed"], dynamic_axes should be {"source":[0,2],}
- hifigan for Diffusion model: input_names should be ["c", "f0"], output_names should be ["audio"], dynamic_axes should be {"c":[0,1], "f0":[0,1],}
- hifigan for Tacotron2: input_names should be ["x"], output_names should be ["audio"], dynamic_axes should be {"x":[0,1],}

- 2、 You may not sell the program and its affiliated sub-models, and you will be responsible for all consequences resulting from such sale.

## Q & A.
### Q: Will the project charge in the future?
    A: The project is permanently open source and free. If there is a paid version of this software elsewhere, please report it immediately to your shopping site and do not buy it, it is permanently free. If you would like to support Shirakana by making a donation, you can go to https://afdian.net/a/NaruseMioShirakana for more information.
### Q: Do you offer a paid model training service?
    A: In principle we do not offer this service. Training TTS models is relatively simple and there is no need to spend money on it, just follow the online tutorials step by step. In addition we offer a free Onnx conversion service.
### Q: How do we determine if a piece is "digital junk"?
    A: 1. Originality. The percentage of your own stuff in the overall project (for AI, creations using models trained entirely independently by you belong to you; work generated using someone else's model belongs to someone else). Aspects covered include, but are not limited to, programming, artwork, audio, designing, etc. For example, a game that uses a template from an engine's market such as Unity is "digital junk".

    2. Developer attitude. The attitude of the author is whether he or she is trying to make a profit or simply to satisfy vanity. For example, if the game is promoted with exaggerated adjectives such as "the first" or "the best" to attract attention, but turns out to be very bad or mediocre, and the author clearly has no intention of making the game properly, this type of work is "digital junk".
    
    3. We oppose any commercial use of AI models trained from unlicensed datasets.
### Q: Technical support?
    A: If it can be established that what you are doing is not “digital junk” and is also legally compliant and not heavily political, I will provide some technical support where I can.

---
## Usage:
    1、Download the software package in the release and unzip it.

    2. Download the appropriate sub-models or additional modules from the [Vocoder & HiddenUnitBert] repository above and place them in the appropriate folders, the correspondence between the sub-models and the project will be mentioned below.

    3. Place the model in the "Mods" folder and select the model from the model selection module at the top left, for the standard model structure please refer to "Supported Projects" below

    4, enter the text to be converted in the input box below, click on "Enable Plugin" to execute the text Cleaner, and change the line to the batch conversion clause symbols (SoVits/DiffSvc need to enter the audio path, DiffSinger need to enter the path of the ds or json project file)

    5, click on "start synthesis" to start synthesizing the voice,then wait for the progress to complete.When the audio is ready,you can preview the audio in the player at the top right,and you can also save the audio file directly at the top right of the interface.

    6、It can also be run from the command line: (version 1.X only)
    Shell: & '. \xxx.exe' "ModDir" "InputText." "outputDir" "Symbol"
    CMD: "xxx.exe" "ModDir" "InputText." "outputDir" "Symbol"
    where ModDir is the "model path\\model name" e.g. "Mods\\Shiroha\\\Shiroha"
    InputText is the text to be converted (only spaces, commas and letters are supported)
    outputDir is the output file name (not the path, but the file name, no need to add suffixes)
    See below for Symbol relevance.
    The output file is in the "tmpDir" folder by default.
---
## Model adaption:
- The software standardises the model reading module, models are saved in a sub-folder under the Mods folder. A json file like "********.json" is a model configuration file, which is used to declare the model path and its display name.You need to convert the model to an Onnx model before you can use it. The codes used to convert these models can be found in the repositories on my Github page.

### General configuration (required, otherwise the software will not recognise the model).
- Folder: The name of the folder where the model is stored
- Name: the name of the model to be displayed in the UI
- Type: type of the model(see below)
- Rate: the sampling rate (must be exactly the same as the rate you set during training)

## Symbol settings
    For example：_-!'(),.:;? ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    Open the project you are using to train the model, open text\symbol.py and join the 4 strings above in the order of the underlined list as shown
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40709280/183290732-dcb93323-1061-431b-aafa-c285a3ec5e82.png)

## Cleaner settings
```cxx
/*
The Cleaner should be placed in the Cleaners folder in the root directory and should be a dynamic library (.dll) defined as required. The dll should be named Cleaner and the Cleaner name is what is entered in the "Cleaner" of the model configuration file.
The following functions need to be defined for all plug-in dlls, the function name must be PluginMain and the Dll name must be the plug-in name (or Cleaner name).
*/
const wchar_t* PluginMain(const wchar_t*);
// The interface only requires consistent input and output, not consistent functionality, which means that you can implement any functionality you want in the Dll, such as ChatGpt, translation, etc.
// Using ChatGpt as an example, the PluginMain function passes in an input string input, passes that input into ChatGpt, passes ChatGpt's output into PluginMain, and finally returns the output.
wchar_t* PluginMain(wchar_t* input){
    wchar_t* tmpOutput = ChatGpt(input);
    return Clean(tmpOutput);
}
// Note: Please use the extern "C" keyword when exporting the dll to prevent destructive naming in C++.
